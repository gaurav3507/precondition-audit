"""Synthetic s* vs d sweep: where does the ranktest start detecting nonlinearity?

WHAT THIS MEASURES. The detection threshold s* is the smallest s at which the
rejection rate crosses out of level control, reported as a function of the
latent dimension d.

TWO REGIMES, DEFAULT LINEAR (--mixing). The headline runs under LINEAR mixing,
the regime where the LFC test holds its level (gate0, gate1). There s does NOT
enter the mixing: it is a grid label only, and the artefact records
s_enters_mixing = false, so the flat curve reads as validity rather than a
swept threshold. Under NONLINEAR mixing (--mixing nonlinear) s is gate2's
leaky-ReLU nonlinearity scale and the mixing manufactures apparent rank
structure, but that is the blocked Phase-B regime where rejection is confounded
with mixing curvature, so an s* measured there is contaminated. Both regimes
are kept; the mixing is recorded top-level in every artefact so no reader can
mistake one for the other.

NOTHING IS REIMPLEMENTED. The statistic, the projection and the standardiser are
imported from 80_ranktest_core.py; the simulator and the step-0 oracle gate are
imported from 81_ranktest_oracle.py. Both are loaded through importlib in the
same pattern 40_screen_norman.py uses for 03_screen.py, so the arithmetic is
byte-identical to the committed gates. A divergent second copy of either is the
defect this lane has already paid for once, so there is not one here. Neither 80
nor 81 is modified, and the md5 of 80 is recorded in every artefact.

THE DECISION RULE IS 80'S, NOT INVENTED. Each draw is decided by
reject_rank2_cf from 80.rank_diagnostic, which is the LFC test at r = 2 and
level alpha: reject when the statistic exceeds the (1 - alpha) bootstrap
critical value. See _lfc_rank_test and rank_diagnostic in 80.

THE s* CROSSING LEVEL IS 81'S, NOT INVENTED. The rejection RATE is bracketed
against the same over-rejection boundary gate0 uses for its verdict,
alpha + 2 Monte-Carlo standard errors at this draw count. A rate above it is
what gate0 already calls loss of level control. The raw per-cell rates are
written too, so the brackets can be recomputed at any other level without
rerunning.

COARSE GRID, HONESTLY REPORTED. Five s points is a coarse grid. s* is reported
as the bracketing interval [s_lo, s_hi] it falls in, left- or right-censored
when the crossing sits outside the grid. No point estimate is interpolated and
no law is fitted through five brackets. Any trend number is labelled a coarse
trend estimate and no R^2 is reported.

PURELY SYNTHETIC. This reads and writes nothing under results/descriptives or
results/preprocessing. Its only output is results/decay/.

Usage (A100). Long-running batch job; launch detached:

    nohup python -u scripts/82_ranktest_decay.py > logs/decay.log 2>&1 &

    python scripts/82_ranktest_decay.py --smoke                  # linear (default)
    python scripts/82_ranktest_decay.py --smoke --mixing linear
    python scripts/82_ranktest_decay.py --mixing nonlinear       # Phase-B regime

No em dashes anywhere in this file, by lane style rule.
