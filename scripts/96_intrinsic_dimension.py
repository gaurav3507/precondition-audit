"""Nonlinear intrinsic dimension of the control-cell matrices, matched to Table II.

WHY. The manuscript treats the observed control-covariance dimension as a lower
bound on latent dimension. That holds under linear noiseless mixing and fails
under nonlinear mixing: a one-dimensional latent embedded as (z, z^2) has a
rank-2 covariance and a manifold dimension of 1. So the covariance number can be
an order of magnitude too large without anything being wrong with it. This
measures the manifold dimension directly, at the same matched sample size, so
the paper can say whether the two agree in order of magnitude.

Precondition 3 is scoped and kept if intrinsic dimension lands near the
participation ratio, and reframed if it lands an order of magnitude lower.
NOTHING HERE IS TUNED TO FAVOUR EITHER OUTCOME, and the design that makes that
claim checkable is:

  * Every estimator that is run is reported, including ones that disagree.
    There is no preferred estimator and no post-hoc selection.
  * Neighbourhood parameters are fixed constants declared at the top of this
    file. MLE is reported across k in {5, 10, 20, 50} precisely because it is
    known to be k-sensitive, and reporting one k would hide that.
  * The correlation-dimension fit window is fixed by percentile of the pairwise
    distance distribution, stated up front, never chosen per dataset.
  * If the estimators disagree by more than a factor of two, that disagreement
    is the finding. It is recorded as `estimators_disagree` and stated in the
    summary rather than resolved by picking one.

STEP-0 SYNTHETIC GATE RUNS FIRST, ALWAYS. Five cases with known answers at the
shape of the real matrices; three are gated and two are calibration only. There is no flag that skips it: main() calls it
before the loaders are even imported, and a failure exits non-zero. Case 2 is
the whole point of the exercise. If the estimator returns the inflated
covariance rank on a nonlinear embedding of 10 latents, it cannot answer the
question this script exists to answer and the run stops there.

Cases 4 and 5 are calibration and are deliberately NOT gated on recovery. Case 3
showed the estimator's empirical ceiling at this (n, p) sits below the top of the
range the real participation ratios occupy, which means a real value near that
ceiling may be censored rather than measured. Cases 4 and 5 put known linear
dimensions inside that range and record how far short the estimate falls, so the
real numbers can be read against a measured bias instead of an assumed one.

NO VERDICT ON THE DATA. This reports dimension estimates. It runs no rank test,
expresses no assumption verdict, and Phase B remains not authorised.
